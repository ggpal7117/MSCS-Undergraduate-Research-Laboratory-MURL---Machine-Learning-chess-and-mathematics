# MSCS-Undergraduate-Research-Laboratory-MURL---Machine-Learning-chess-and-mathematics

Report Link: https://gamma.app/docs/Chess-AI-Evolution-Gourav-Pal-Progress-Report-4yg815k1ktyev15

A unified research and teaching repository exploring adversarial search algorithms, game-theoretic decision making, and Monte-Carlo–based planning through three progressively complex domains:

The Stick Game — a minimal environment for learning Minimax & Alpha–Beta Pruning

Constrained Chess Engine — real chess logic using python-chess with custom AI search

Monte Carlo Methods & MCTS — sampling-based evaluation and full Monte Carlo Tree Search

This lab showcases the evolution of AI decision-making from deterministic search (minimax) to statistical tree-based methods (MCTS), including visualizations, notebooks, and reproducible experiments.

## 🎮 Included Projects

### 1. Stick Game — Minimax 
A small 1-or 2-sticks-per-turn game ideal for introducing adversarial search utilizing recursive minimax implementation

### 2. Constrained Chess AI (python-chess)
A lightweight chess engine demonstrating search in a complex state space.

### 3. Monte Carlo Methods (MCM)

A collection of experiments introducing statistical evaluation, sampling, and random policies.

Includes:
naive Monte-Carlo evaluation of game positions
value estimation under different rollout policies
variance reduction via repeated sampling

### 4. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Drafted a modular implementation used to play stick games and simplified chess.

Includes:
Tree node class with visit count & value
UCT formula
